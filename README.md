==========

MiCasa is an application for the Pebble smartwatch to toggle power to your Z-Wave devices through a Vera controller.

Never will you need to get your phone out again to switch on your lights!

### Instructions

This currently needs a bit of work to split out the config into a separate file.
For now, you can take this, add your Vera's local ip, make sure the device IDs are correct in the menu and then push to your watch.
